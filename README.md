# biker_info

This service provides weather information to bikers and uses a JSON file as its database.

This version of the application is designed for developers to run locally without needing to set up additional services, such as a dedicated database.

To run it locally, use the command `go run .` . The only prerequisite is having the Go compiler installed.
